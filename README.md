## 🏎️ #AutonomousRacing

**AutonomousRacing** is a 2D simulation environment for developing and testing autonomous driving systems using reinforcement learning. Built with OpenAI Gym, this project allows researchers and developers to experiment with custom tracks, virtual sensors (like LiDAR), and various reinforcement learning algorithms to train agents for autonomous racing tasks.
